# Pax6-Fst-Tgfb2_Reaction_Diffusion_Models

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with reaction diffusion models of the Pax6-Fst-Tgfb2 gene network, as described in the preprint article "The Pax6 master control gene initiates spontaneous retinal development via a self-organising Turing network": https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/583807v1
